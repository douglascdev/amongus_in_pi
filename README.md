# Among Us in pi

```
   ________
__|  ______|

An algorithm that scans the digits of pi for the amongus above in binary form:

```
0, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 0, 0,
1, 1, 1, 1,
0, 1, 0, 1,
```

After seeing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dET2l8l3upU) by Matt Parker I wanted to implement my own algorithm to search for amonguses(or amongi, as Matt calls them lol). Let's see how it goes.
